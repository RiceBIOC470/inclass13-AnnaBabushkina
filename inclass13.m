%Inclass 13. 

% Continue with the set of images you used for inclass 12, the same time 
% point (t = 30)

% 1. Use the channel that marks the cell nuclei. Produce an appropriately
% smoothed image with the background subtracted. 

% 2. threshold this image to get a mask that marks the cell nuclei. 

% 3. Use any morphological operations you like to improve this mask (i.e.
% no holes in nuclei, no tiny fragments etc.)

% 4. Use the mask together with the images to find the mean intensity for
% each cell nucleus in each of the two channels. Make a plot where each data point 
% represents one nucleus and these two values are plotted against each other
